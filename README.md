# URL-Detector
 A high-performance utility designed to identify, parse, and categorize URLs. This tool helps developers and security researchers detect malicious links, identify tracking parameters, and validate URL structures in real-time.  🚀 Features Malicious Link Detection: Uses heuristic analysis and blacklists to flag potential phishing or malware-hosting URLs.  Protocol Validation: Ensures URLs follow standard http, https, or ftp protocols.  Domain Extraction: Deep-parsing to separate subdomains, TLDs, and port numbers.  Entropy Scoring: Calculates the randomness of a URL string to detect DGA (Domain Generation Algorithms) often used in botnets.  Shortener Expansion: (Optional) Unmasks shortened URLs (bit.ly, tinyurl) to reveal the final destination.
